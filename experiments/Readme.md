This folder contains experiments as detailed in the paper. See `Experiments.ipynb` for the code of the experiments performed on a synthetic dataset `NCD_synthetic.csv`. Thus the results shown in the notebook are not exactly the same as those in the paper.

To show that the synthetic dataset is a good proxy of the real dataset, we compare their correlation matrices.
